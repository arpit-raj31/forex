            Contracts for Difference (hereinafter “CFDs”) are complex
            instruments that provide no capital protection, and no guaranteed
            return, whereas the trading results are magnified due to the effect
            of leverage. Trading CFDs is not suitable for all investors; traders
            should make sure that they fully understand the features of the
            product and the risks involved before opening trading account(s).
            Traders should ensure that they only trade the amounts they can
            afford to lose, while being aware of trading risks.

            Scope of the Risk Disclosure
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Risk Disclosure and Warning Notice (hereinafter “Risk Disclosure
            document”) outlines on a fair and non-misleading basis the general
            nature of the risks involved when dealing with CFDs. Clients should
            not commence trading in CFDs unless they understand the risks
            involved. It should be noted that it is impossible for the Risk
            Disclosure document to contain all the risks and aspects involved in
            trading CFDs, nor how such risks relate to each client's personal
            circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clients need to ensure that their decision is made on an informed
            basis. Clients may seek professional independent advice before
            commencing trading. This disclosure is provided for informational
            purposes and should not be treated as marketing material or any form
            of client solicitation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Risk Disclosure document should be read in conjunction with the
            Client Agreement and General Business Terms that are available on
            the website.

            Main Risks Associated with Transactions in CFDs
          </h2>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
            Use of Leverage
          </h3>
          <p>
            Leverage in CFD transactions allows clients to gain exposure to the
            underlying asset with a smaller upfront investment, known as margin.
            While leverage is a powerful tool, it can be seen as a double-edged
            sword. This is because both profits and losses can be magnified by
            even small market movements; and clients could incur large losses if
            their position moves against them. However, retail clients cannot
            lose more than the balance on their trading account(s) as the
            Company provides “negative balance protection”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before investing in margin trading instruments, clients shall ensure
            that they only invest funds that they can aord to lose.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
            Credit and Insolvency Risk
          </h3>
          <p>
            When trading CFDs, clients are effectively entering into an
            over-the-counter (hereinafter “OTC”) transaction; this implies that
            any position opened with the Company cannot be closed with any other
            entity. OTC transactions may involve greater risk compared to
            transactions executed on regulated markets (e.g. traditional
            exchanges); this is due to the fact that in OTC transactions, there
            is no central counterparty and either party to the transaction bears
            certain counterparty credit risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company’s insolvency or default may lead to positions being
            liquidated or closed out without the client’s consent.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">Market Risk</h3>
          <p>
            CFDs are exposed to market events, such as the implementation of
            governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and
            policies, national and international socioeconomic and political
            events, natural disasters etc., which may substantially affect the
            price or availability of a given underlying asset.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the underlying of each contract, clients are exposed to
            dierent types of market risk such as interest rate risk, commodity
            risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, and others. Clients must
            therefore carefully consider their investment objectives, level of
            knowledge and experience as well as their risk appetite prior to
            entering this market.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
            Volatility Risk
          </h3>
          <p>
            Volatility risk can signicantly impact a CFD position, as higher
            volatility may lead to larger price swings, increasing both the
            potential prots and losses. Clients should understand and agree that
            if market conditions become abnormal and/or too volatile, the time
            required to process their orders and instructions may increase.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
            Foreign Exchange/Currency Risk
          </h3>
          <p>
            Be aware of currency risk. It is possible to buy or sell CFDs in a
            currency that is dierent from the base currency of your account. In
            such cases, the movement in foreign exchange rates may aect your
            realized prot or loss. Furthermore, clients face foreign exchange
            risk if they make payments in a currency that diers from the
            currency of their trading accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            In such cases, the bid-ask spread may become wider, making
            transactions more expensive
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
            Liquidity Risk
          </h3>
          <p>
            Liquidity risk refers to the possibility that certain underlying
            assets may not be readily tradable or lack immediate market
            liquidity during a specific time frame, which could result in losses
            that are difficult to prevent or mitigate.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
            Technical Risk
          </h3>
          <p>
            Technical risk is an inherent aspect of online trading, encompassing
            potential challenges arising from hardware and software failures,
            connectivity issues, electricity network failures, hacker attacks,
            connection overload, system malfunctions, and other technical
            factors that may impact order execution and overall trading
            performance. Traders should use reliable technology and antivirus
            software, and maintain a stable internet connection. Additionally,
            they should implement eective risk management trading strategies and
            stay informed about platform updates while having contingency plans
            for technical failures. Traders should refrain from sharing login
            credentials and should utilize strong and unique passwords.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
            Trading Platforms
          </h3>
          <p>
            All clients' instructions are sent to our server and executed in
            order. Therefore, clients cannot send a second order until their
            previous order has been executed. If a second order is received
            before the rst is processed, the second order will be rejected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clients assume responsibility for any unplanned trading operation
            that may be executed if they resubmit an order before being notied
            of the results of the rst order. Clients must understand that
            closing the order window or position window does not cancel a
            submitted order.
          </p>

          <p>
            Clients acknowledge that only the quotes received from our server
            are valid. If there is a problem in the connection between the
            client terminal and our server, the client can retrieve undelivered
            quote data from the client terminal's quote database.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
          Communication
          </h3>
          <p>
          There is a risk that the client may miss important communications if their communication channels are not up-to-date or functioning properly. It is crucial for the client to ensure that their contact information is current and reliable to avoid any potential communication gaps and associated consequences.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
          Abnormal Market Conditions
          </h3>
          <p>
          Suspensions of Trading Under certain trading conditions, it may be dicult or impossible to execute or liquidate a position, or the period during which the Clients’ orders are executed may be extended. This may occur, for example, at times of rapid price movement, when the prices rise or fall in one trading session to such an extent that trading may be suspended or restricted. Placing a stop loss order will not necessarily eliminate clients’ losses to the intended amounts, because market conditions may make it impossible to execute such an order at the stipulated price. In addition, under certain market conditions, the price at which a stop loss order is executed may be worse than its stipulated price and the realized losses can be greater than expected.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
          Force Majeure Events
          </h3>
          <p>
          The Company is not responsible for nancial losses arising from force majeure events. These events are extreme and unavoidable circumstances that are independent of the will and actions of the agreement participants, and that cannot be foreseen, prevented, or eliminated, including but not limited to natural disasters, res, man-made accidents and disasters, emergencies at utility works and on utility lines, DDOS attacks, riots, military actions, terrorist attacks, uprisings, civil unrest, strikes, and the regulatory acts of state and local government authorities.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
          Slippage
          </h3>
          <p>
          Slippage is a phenomenon when the requested price has slipped, i.e. the order was opened with a dierent price from the requested price. It refers to the dierence between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. Slippage can occur at any time, but is most prevalent during periods of high volatility. Slippage does not denote a negative or positive movement because any dierence between the intended execution price and the actual execution price qualies as slippage. The nal execution price vs. the intended execution price can be categorized as positive slippage, no slippage, or negative slippage. A market order may get executed at a less or more favorable price than originally intended when this happens. Risks associated with the laws of individual governments Clients assume responsibility for trading and non-trading operations performed within countries where they are restricted or prohibited by law.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
          Third-Party Risk
          </h3>
          <p>
          The Company may deposit client money with a third party. Although the Company shall exercise due skill, care, and diligence in the selection of such a party, it is understood that there are circumstances beyond the control of the Company and hence the Company does not accept any liability or responsibility for any resulting losses to the client as a result of the insolvency or any other analogous proceedings or failure of such third parties.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
          Additional Disclosures
          </h3>
          <p>
          Margin Requirements Clients must maintain the minimum margin requirement on their open positions at all times. It is the clients' responsibility to monitor their account balance and ensure that sucient funds are in place to cover their trading strategy and minimum margin requirements. Failure to do so, may result in positions in the client's trading account, being liquidated. Clients should not rely on last-minute deposits.

          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
          Rights to Underlying Assets
          </h3>
          <p>
          CFDs do not provide any rights to the underlying instruments.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
          Taxation
          </h3>
          <p>
          The clients should seek independent tax advice, if necessary, to establish whether they are subject to any tax, including stamp duty.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600">
          Impersonation Risk
          </h3>
          <p>
          There might be cases of fraudulent impersonation of the Company’s ocers and representatives. Clients should not share their personal data, including information about their trading accounts, with persons who appear to represent the Company unless they have ensured that such persons communicate from the ocial contact details and domains of the Company.
